A Minecraft Java Mod created through MCreator in 2021! Mainly made as an exploratary step into the domain of minecraft java programming!

This project was made as part of a fun little side project over the holidays, and to see behind the scenes of how minecraft's code/modding structure was like.
Thus, the mod includes a bit of everything, from weapons to ore-generation to bosses and others, albeit minimal complexity due to the nature of MCreator's block programming.
